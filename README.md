# BeautifulSoupPublix
BeautifulSoup Python script for checking if Publix chicken tender subs are on sale or not

Looks like this may not work anymore as Publix changed their site to require a zip code to be input before it will render the element that BeautifulSoup is checking for. May need to move to something like Selenium.
